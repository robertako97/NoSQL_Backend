### Installation
*Steps required to install project and how to get the development environment running:*

Just run `npm run devStart` ot `node server` to connect to mongoDB! Of course, don't forget to clone the git repo.

### Usage
*Instructions and examples for use:*

The backend application doesn't include any front-end side, so you'll need a thiird application framwork to interact with the data. Of course you can use MongoDB Compass, but you can get fancy using the actual local connection [or use Heroku], to utilice the connections necessaries  with insomnia/postman or develop a easy to use front-end application.

### Contributing
*If you would like to contribute, you can follow these guidelines for how to do so:*

You can send into the repo any feature, highly recommended to include the front end using handlebars to render the info.

### Features
`mongoose`, `expressjs` and the use of `nodemon1 to facilitate the development of the project. Pretty standard models.

### Testing
*Tests for application and how to run them:*
